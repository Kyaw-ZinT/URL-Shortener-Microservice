# URL-Shortener-Microservice
The URL Shortener Microservice is a simple API that allows users to submit a long URL and receive a shortened version in return. When the short URL is accessed, the user is redirected to the original URL. This project demonstrates how to handle URL encoding/decoding, data validation, and redirection using Node.js and Express.js.
